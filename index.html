<h2 id="project-summary">What is Southern Bathtub Race?</h2>
<p><strong>Southern Bathtub Race</strong> is a video game commemorating the annual <strong>Southern Polytechnic State University Bathtub 
    Races held</strong> from 1968 - 1991. 
    The player controls a bathtub racer from a 1st-person perspective as they compete against the computer 
    to navigate a racetrack modeled after the SPSU campus of 1991. The environmental assets and textures were 
    created with traditional acrylic painting. The game is intended to replicate the races and student spirit on the 
    SPSU campus for both SPSU alumni and KSU students.

<h2 id="more-info">More About the Real Race</h2>
<p>The SPSU bathtub races brought the entire campus together every semester to watch or participate in the event. For engineering students, it was an opportunity
 to put into practice what they had been learning in their classes. For everyone else, it was a fun day in the sun. Teams of students collaborated to build 
race karts made from cast iron bathtub (which weighed around 140 pounds) and attached lightweight engines to them, such as those from motorcycles or lawnmowers.</p>

<p>Various sponsors, ranging from local businesses to major companies, financed the teams. In the weeks leading up to the races, there was much to be done. 
The road looping around campus served as the racetrack and was lined with tires. A temporary bridge was erected to allow pedestrians to safely navigate the campus during 
the race.</p>

<p>Interested in seeing what the races were like back then? Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/tJv4Sn9N7Xk?si=3BOa2jyzDb5fM5DK">compilation</a> of recordings.</p>
